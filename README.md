# HR SQL Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Built a relational HR analytics database to analyze employee salaries, performance, and workforce metrics using SQL. The project transforms raw HR data into structured insights to support data-driven HR decisions across multiple departments.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (JOINs, CTEs, Window Functions)
- Aggregations, Subqueries
- Data Modeling & ER Design

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Analyzed **500+ employee records** across **8+ departments**
- Calculated average and total salary distribution by department
- Evaluated performance ratings for **100% of employees**
- Identified **top 10% high-performing employees** using window functions
- Tracked headcount and role distribution across the organization

## 📈 Business Insights
- Identified **2 departments** accounting for **~40% of total salary spend**
- Revealed performance–salary gaps for **15% of employees**
- Highlighted top performers for promotion and retention planning
- Provided workforce metrics to support HR capacity planning

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `schema.sql` – HR database schema and table design
- `queries.sql` – Advanced SQL analysis queries
- `dataset.csv` – Sample HR dataset

## 🛠️ Key Features
* **Normalized Tables:** Separated into Departments, Jobs, and Employees to reduce data redundancy.
* **Hierarchical Tracking:** Used a self-referencing `manager_id` to track organizational structure.
* **Relational Integrity:** Implemented Primary and Foreign Keys to ensure data accuracy.

## 🎯 Outcome
Demonstrates hands-on SQL analytics experience, advanced querying skills, and the ability to convert HR data into measurable business insights—aligned with entry-level Data Analyst role expectations.
